#Scenario: Mr. Carl Merkel owns a small business called “CM Mobiles”. He wants to create a new table to store key information about customers.

mysql> USE cm_devices;
mysql> CREATE TABLE customers( usernameCHAR(9), fullName VARCHAR(100), email VARCHAR(255));
#Shows customers' usernames, first and last names, and email addresses
mysql> CREATE TABLE feedback ( feedbackID CHAR(8), feedbackID VARCHAR(100), comment TEXT(500));
#Gives each piece of feedback a unique ID, shows positive or negative feedback, and then anything else the customer wanted to elaborate on in the text column

#Learned how to work with string values in a database :)
