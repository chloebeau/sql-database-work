# sql-database-work
Some of these SQL projects were done as part of my backend development coursework in Meta's Databases for Backend Developers certification.
After the work I did on those projects, I absolutely fell in love with SQL and created some more projects in hopes that one day I'd be hired to create or build upon relational databases.
Now, I realize that learning SQL on top of the 14-hour days I spent prior learning Python - that I just love to write code that creates things that solve problems.
Here is some of mySQL database work!
