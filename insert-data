#Scenario
#Mr. John Ericson owns a small bookshop. 
#He decides to build a digital database to maintain data about his customers electronically instead of using pen and paper. In this exercise, youâ€™ll build the bookshop database.

mysql> CREATE DATABASE bookshop;
mysql> USE bookshop;
mysql> CREATE TABLE customers ( customer ID INT, customerName VARCHAR(50), customerAddress VARCHAR(255));
mysql> INSERT INTO customers (customer ID, customerName, customerAddress); VALUES (1, "Jack", "115 Old St Belfast");
mysql> SELECT * FROM customers;

#created a table in a database and inserted info into the table.
